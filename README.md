# About

Whilst a little uninspiring, our goal is to recreate the [Bootstrap Blog Template](http://getbootstrap.com/examples/blog/) using Wordpress.

This repo builds on [Tania Rascia's WP Theme tutorial](https://www.taniarascia.com/developing-a-wordpress-theme-from-scratch/) to build a basic Bootstrap-based WP Theme.

We're using this repo to show a new developer how to create a basic theme and collaborate using git.

# Installation

As you'll be using [Local by Flywheel](https://localbyflywheel.com/) your Wordpress installation should be in `~/Local Sites`. That's inside `Local Sites` in your home directory on Windows.

If you named your installation `robsharp`, then open a terminal and `cd` to `Local Sites/robsharp/app/public/wp-content/themes/`.

Here, you'll need to clone this repo into the themes directory.

`git clone https://github.com/qnm/startertheme.git`

This will add a new directory (folder) to this directory, and make it available for `git`.

Lastly, switch your Wordpress site to use the theme.

Assuming your site is `robsharp` then visit `http://robsharp.local/wp-admin/themes.php` and hit 'Activate' on `startertheme`.

We're now ready to begin 'Dividing our Page' below.
